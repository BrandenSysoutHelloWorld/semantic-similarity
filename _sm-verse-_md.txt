"'Run the example file with the simpler language model ‘en_core_web_sm’ and write a note on what you notice is different from the model 'en_core_web_md'"

    ANSWER:
        When comparing strings of text both _sm and _md models seem to base results on entity relationships and due to the face that the _md model is trained on
        a larger dataset than the _sm the _md model similarities score is will be higher. With the example.py I noticed when comparing complaints and recipes the _md
        model finds more similarities than the _sm. I believe this is because of the reason I outlined above, the _md model has more data to compare entities such as verbs, 
        nouns, etc...

        An appropriate approach would be to use Named Entity Relationship when comparing long string of unrelated categories of data such as, complaints and recipes.
